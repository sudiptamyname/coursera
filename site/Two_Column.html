<div><p id="p1">Increasingly, many scientific techniques are used by the archaeologist, and he uses the scientific expertise of many persons who are not archaeologists in his work. The artifacts he studies must often be studied in their environmental contexts, and botanists, zoologists, soil scientists, and geologists may be brought in to identify and describe plants, animals, soils, and rocks. Radioactive carbon dating, which has revolutionized much of archaeological chronology, is a by-product of research in atomic physics. But although archaeology uses extensively the methods, techniques, and results of the physical and biological sciences, it is not a natural science; some consider it a discipline that is half science and half humanity. Perhaps it is more accurate to say that the archaeologist is first a craftsman, practicing many specialized crafts (of which excavation is the most familiar to the general public), and then a historian.</p>
	 <p id="p2">It is usually said that what you chose to do on the very first day of a new year will dictate how the rest of your year goes. But it is cold outside and you may be wanted to snuggle in bed and stay home. But throw away those feelings of lethargy, shake off the old and jump into 2023 with gusto. To help you along the way, here us a list of fun activities that you and your loved ones can go around the city to begin the new year right. The archaeologist is first a descriptive worker: he has to describe, classify, and analyze the artifacts he studies. An adequate and objective taxonomy is the basis of all archaeology, and many good archaeologists spend their lives in this activity of description and classification. But the main aim of the archaeologist is to place the material remains in historical contexts, to supplement what may be known from written sources, and, thus, to increase understanding of the past. Ultimately, then, the archaeologist is a historian: his aim is the interpretive description of the past of man. Each country profile provides links to official web sites of a nation/territory, information on geography, maps, the national flag, history, culture, tourist destinations, its population and languages, the capital and the largest cities, education, economy, newspapers, and much more.</p>
